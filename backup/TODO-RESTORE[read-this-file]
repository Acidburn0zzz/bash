In theory, switching SRC with DST rsync should restore something. Need more testing.

tar.gz can be extracted correctly probably with:
sudo tar -xzfvp  nomefile.tar.gz  // sudo let keep the owner and permission with p. 
(the p caused some problems the last time I tried...)

To restore installed packages I should execute this commands (maybe try with virtualbox first)

sudo dpkg --clear-selections
sudo dpkg --set-selections < $FOLDER_DST/package.list && sudo apt-get dselect-upgrade

where folder_dst  is the external HD path
